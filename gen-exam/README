Exam generation library. See ../exam-expl/ for examples of usage of
this library.

As a user, you have to define an "exam subject", that is a script,
generating the set of questions for your exam. For example,
../exam-expl/demo-exam-ensimag2011-en.sh is an "exam subject". For
explanations on how to write an exam subject, see
../exam-expl/exam-test.sh and the comments it contains.

Run your exam subject script with --help to see the available options.

It is advised to test the exam in "demo mode", i.e. using the --demo
option first. In demo mode, no database is used:

* Questions and expected answers are encoded directly in PHP,

* Actual answers are memorized in cookies.

In SQL mode, the global picture is:

* ./init-db.sh generates an SQL script to initialize a database. Run
  the SQL script with e.g. mysql (or a web interface like phpMyAdmin to initialize the database on the
  server.

* The exam subject is a script (which uses the generation library),
  which generates:

  - questions.sql, to be executed with e.g. mysql, to fill-in the
    database with questions and expected answers.

  - 1/ and 2/, containing the content of accounts for students. At
    Ensimag, we have a system to deploy it automatically on students
    machines. You may distribute this to students with any system (at
    worse, tar them and drop them on your webserver, and ask students
    to download them).

  - php/ containing PHP code to put on the web server.

  (the script will remind you this at the end of execution)
