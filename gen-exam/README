Exam generation library. See ../exam-expl/ for examples of usage of
this library.

As a user, you have to define an "exam subject", that is a script,
generating the set of questions for your exam. For example,
../exam-expl/demo-exam-ensimag2011-en.sh is an "exam subject". For
explanations on how to write an exam subject, see
../exam-expl/exam-test.sh and the comments it contains.
