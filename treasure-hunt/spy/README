This is the monitoring system for the treasure hunt.

The idea is to record the fact that a student reached a step in a
database, to allow the teachers to get an idea of how many students
reached which step of the hunt. This is done silently on the students
side (even failures of the monitoring system should be unnoticed). To
be able to monitor a step, we need to be able to identify the student,
and execute a piece of code, hence not all steps are monitorable (but
steps where students execute a script on a school machine can
basically use $LOGNAME).

The monitoring system is implemented as a web interface: monitored
steps access

  $spy_url/record.php?login=<student's login>&step=<step name>

and teachers can view the list at

  $spy_url/list.php

(password protected. Do not use a sensitive password, it is stored
cleartext on the server). To install it, you need a webspace with PHP
and MySQL. Several steps are needed:

* Set your database parameters in db-setup.sh

* Initialize the database (create tables & cie) : init-db.sh

* Optionally, import a list of students login from a CSV in the
  database : import-students.sh
  This will allow list.php to display informations like which
  group/year the student belongs to.

* Setup the webserver (i.e. install PHP files) : setup-webserver.sh

If you want to write new monitored steps, look at spy-lib.sh
