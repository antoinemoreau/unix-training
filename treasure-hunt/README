To install the hunt on your machine, you need to (in theory):

1) Read and edit treasure-setup.sh

2) Check your system:

   - Run ./test-i18n.sh and check the output.
   - Run ./test-cmds.sh and check the output.

3) run "make install" (reading the Makefile may help understanding the
   generation process, in particular how multi-lingual hunt is
   managed)

4) Set up the database for monitoring steps (see spy/db-setup.sh and
   other scripts in the spy/ directory).

In practice, installing the hunt outside Ensimag may require tweaking
the code (but at least the main part of the game has already been
adapted twice outside Ensimag). If you need help doing this, contact
me: Matthieu Moy <Matthieu.Moy@imag.fr>

To understand how the code works, good starting points are:

- treasure-setup.sh
- generate-all.sh and upload-to-servers.sh
- Makefile (especially about internationalization)
- The expl/ directory.
