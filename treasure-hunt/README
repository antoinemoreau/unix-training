To install the hunt on your machine, you need to (in theory):

1) Read and edit treasure-setup.sh

2) run "make install" (reading the Makefile may help understanding the
   generation process, in particular how multi-lingual hunt is
   managed)

3) Set up the database for monitoring steps (see spy/db-setup.sh and
   other scripts in the spy/ directory).

In practice, installing the hunt outside Ensimag will most likely
require tweaking the code. If you need help doing this, contact me:

To understand how the code works, good starting points are:

- treasure-setup.sh
- generate-all.sh and upload-to-servers.sh
- Makefile (especially about internationalization)
- The expl/ directory.
