To install the hunt on your machine, you need to (in theory):

1) edit treasure-setup.sh

2) run "make install" (reading the Makefile may help understanding the
generation process, in particular how multi-lingual hunt is managed)

In practice, installing the hunt outside Ensimag will most likely
require tweaking the code. If you need help doing this, contact me:
