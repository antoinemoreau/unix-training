This is the public par of the « Introduction to Unix » course given in
the Ensimag. It is published to satisfy the curiosity of Ensimag's
students, and in the hope that it will be usefull to other scools.

It contains :

* treasure-hunt/ : a set of scripts to generate a treasure hunt for
  students. The treasure hunt is a game, where each level requires a
  technical manipulation, and give access to the next level. The game
  is in french, and tailored for the Ensimag, but could be easily
  adapted to other environments.

* gen-exam/ and exam-expl/ : a lab-work exam generation
  infrastructure. gen-exam/ is the generation library, and exam-expl/
  gives an example use of it. Read exam-expl/exam-tests.sh for a
  commented example, which serves as documentation.
