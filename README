This is the public part of the "Introduction to Unix" course given in
the Ensimag. It was initially published to satisfy the curiosity of
Ensimag's students, and is now used in several other schools.

It contains :

* treasure-hunt/ : a set of scripts to generate a treasure hunt for
  students. The treasure hunt is a game, where each level requires a
  technical manipulation, and give access to the next level. The game
  is in french, and tailored for the Ensimag, but could be easily
  adapted to other environments.

* gen-exam/ and exam-expl/ : a lab-work exam generation
  infrastructure. gen-exam/ is the generation library, and exam-expl/
  gives an example use of it. Read exam-expl/exam-tests.sh for a
  commented example, which serves as documentation.

More information, and online demo for the exam can be found here:
